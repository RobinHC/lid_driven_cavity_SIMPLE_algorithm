# lid_driven_cavity_SIMPLE_algorithm
Lid Driven Cavity - 2D simulation using SIMPLE algorithm for pressure and velocity coupling

A brief summary of the files in this project is as follows:

1. `Solution.pdf`
Comprehensive report on the solving the Navier-Stokes equations in Lid Driven Cavity in two dimension using staggered grid approach for pressure and velocity coupling

## Work in progress

-> developing interactive python modules for the matlab files to directly execute without MATLAB
